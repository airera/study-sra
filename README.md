This repository contains the replication package for the study designing a software reference architecture (SRA) for natural-language processing (NLP) based requirements engineering (RE) tools (NLP4RE).
The design follows the ProSA-RA process by Nakagawa et al.[^1].

> [!important]
> This repository currently contains only 2 out of the 4 staps from the SRA creation framework.
> The remaining 2 steps are future work of the current research preview.

## Usage

Depending on your use case, consult the following files:

- **Replicating the focus group activity**: If you want to replicate the elicitation of requirements from NLP4RE stakeholders, access the *AIRE'25 Interactive Session Instructions.pptx* file that explains the method. For our implementation at AIRE'25, we invited participants to place post-it notes on white boards.
- **Reviewing the architectural analysis**: If you want to review the extraction of requirements from the information sources, access the *Requirements.xlsx* file. In the "System"-tab, you find the requirements in and rationale for them in respective columns. The "Source" and "Locator" columns specify, where this requirement was extracted from. In the *analysis-process.md* file you find a description of the applied extraction and synthesis process.
- **Accessing the requirements**: If you want to check the requirements that we arrived at, review the *Requirements.xlsx* file. Note the "System" and "Architecture" tabs which contain requirements for NLP4RE systems and for a reference architecture respectively.
